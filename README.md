### Uber_DataAnalysis

Situation: 

The Uber_DataAnalysis project aims to analyze Uber trip data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to gain insights into patterns and trends.

Task: The primary tasks include:

Loading and cleaning the Uber trip data.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
Visualizing the data to understand trends and peak times for Uber rides.

Action:

Data Preparation: Loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame and performed initial exploration, including checking for duplicates and null values.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and handled missing values. Converted data types as needed (e.g., converting date strings to datetime objects).
EDA and Visualization: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of trips across different months, days, and hours. Visualized the data using bar plots and point plots to identify peak times and days for Uber rides.

Result: 

The analysis revealed that May has the highest number of Uber pickups in New York City, and the hourly rush starts in the evening from Thursday to Saturday. Visualizations effectively highlight these insights.
